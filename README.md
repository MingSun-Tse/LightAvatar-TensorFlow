# LightAvatar

This repository contains the major source code for our work: **LightAvatar:
Efficient Head Avatar as Dynamic Neural Light Field**.

The code is based on TensorFlow. The release is supposed to provide the key
information (model architecture and loss function) for others to reimplement our
method. The code itself is incomplete and not runnable.
